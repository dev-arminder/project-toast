# Toast Component Project

## Joy of React, Project II

In this project, we'll dive deep into the implementation of a single common UI component: A `<Toast>` message component.Look at the [live version](https://toast-project-mine.vercel.app/).

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out resuable toast component and get it working as per requirement.

## Getting Started

This project is created with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). It's intended to be run locally, on your computer, using Node.js and NPM.

To jog your memory, here are the terminal commands you'll need to run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-arminder/project-toast.git
cd project-toast
npm install
npm run dev
```

To create new components, you can use this helper script. It saves you a bit of time, creating all the files and adding the standard code:

```bash
# Create a new component:
npm run new-component [TheNewComponentName]
```
